# Design
* This document describes the design of the app
* These settings are what I hope to design the app as

## App Design- style.css
* Make all primary headings a light green (#9ACD32)
* Make all secondary headings a light brown (#654321)
* The reason: match the Boulder Flat Irons picture I took with my drone.
* This is the Apps theme image -- because it's prettier than my face :)

## Theme Image
* Located under /bacs350/images
* Callled boulder-irons.jpg
* High resolution photo

## Future Hope for App Design
* Dynamic theme
* Colors match the theme image from a moving carousel
* Multiple CSS stylesheets to reference
* Lots of researched needed to accomplish this goal
