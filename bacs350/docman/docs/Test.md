# Test
This document describes the process used to test the changes to code I made
* First, the application I used
* How I transfered the files
* How I viewed the files
* How I managed version control

## Application Used
* Started using Notepad++ (open source)
* Ended up using Brackets (open source)
* Often used Brackets in Debug mode
    * Prefered multiple windows instead of tabs
    * Excited that Brakets will impliment this later into their application
    * Never crashed while I used it in Debug mode

## File Transfer
* Explaines the process used to upload files for testing
* Had difficulty finding them
* Used open source FTP

### Finding Files   
* Downside of Brackets- single window for multiple documents
* Hard to visualize the file location of documents
    * Would often right click document and select "Reveal and Finder/Explorer" to find it
* Used macOS Mojave & Catalina, and Windows 10 to develop

### FTP
* Used Filezilla to upload files (open source)
* Had to customize connection
* Docuemnted details in secret_settings.php
* Drag and drop to upload files from Explorer/Finder

## Version Control
* Used GitHub Desktop on Windows and macOS
* Committed at the end of a work session
* My "version control"
    * Renamed sensitve files on server from currentname.php to currentname_old.php
    * Not as effective
    * Stopped doing that after GitHub
* Need to commit every hour

## Testing Code
* Would load page in browser
* Held shfit + refresh to force refresh 
    * Did not cache data
    * Helped me see up-to-date code
* Why not locally?
    * My pages referenced items on the web
    * Decided the best environment to test would be in the web
