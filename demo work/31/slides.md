Project 11- Slides (with My Pictures)

* To be honest, I haven't figured it out yet
* Not sure how to design the database.
* Scroll right to see my future goals and photography
* Scroll down to see my progress and what I need to do

## Development Process
* Coppied the code from Mark's server
* Tried to clone it
* Discovered the code kills the PHP page if the database isn't connected
* Not sure how to build the slides database

--

## The result
* Obviously, failure
* Will need to visit with Mark or see some suggestions
* Hence, this slideshow confessing my failure (haha)
* This slideshow is from the demo 31 (see /bacs350/mydemo/31)

## What I learned
For the slides.md file:

* '#' starts a new list (see right ticker)
* '##' will continue the slides down the list
* '*' bullets each point
* '![]'(name) adds a picture/code


---


# Future Goals & Photography
* Figure out the database for project 11. 
* Get it to work
* Update all code with secret_settings.php
* Exclude the code with sensitive passwords
* Publish the 350 code after this work
